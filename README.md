### OneShell: Encrypted (mtls) reverse shell

OneShell is a tool designed to address common problems in reverse shell techniques used in cybersecurity. It focuses on creating a more universal, secure, and easy-to-use payload system that overcomes dependencies and security vulnerabilities typical in traditional reverse shells. The author proposes using Mutual TLS for secure connections and details the creation and deployment of a binary that utilizes minimal dependencies, aiming to be system-agnostic and capable of executing in restrictive environments.

### Maelstrom: A series of blogs I have seen in 2023 discusses an important topic: Building Your Own C2.

The blog series "Maelstrom" explores the development and implementation of Command & Control (C2) frameworks, focusing on their increasing necessity in cybersecurity, particularly in penetration testing and red team operations. The series aims to document the design and effectiveness of a minimum viable C2, analyze evasive techniques necessary for operation on modern systems, and offer insights into endpoint protection challenges. It also intends to discuss architectural decisions, user experience, and operational security, both static and runtime, related to C2 frameworks.

### EDR Telemetry Blocking Via PERSON-IN-THE-MIDDLE Attacks (Require Physical Access):

The blog "Effective EDR Telemetry Blocking via Person-in-the-Middle Network Filtering Attacks" on Tier Zero Security's website describes how to block Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry using ARP spoofing to intercept network traffic. The approach involves person-in-the-middle (PitM) attacks to prevent EDR alerts from reaching cloud servers, employing tools and techniques like iptables and the Scapy library for packet manipulation.

### A series of tweets with lecture videos about advanced operating systems structures and implementation (Spring 2013, UC Berkeley):

This series will be very useful for revising and working on my own project of building a simple OS (for learning purposes only).
